WAKIZASHI QUICK START GUIDE
---------------------------

1. Intstall and activate the theme. First of all you need to download Wakizashi, un-compress 
it and upload all the content to your theme folder (usually located on /wp-content/themes/). Now 
you can activate Wakizashi from the Appearance › Themes panel.

2. From the Appearance › Wakizashi Options panel you can set up some additional features such as:
Google Analytics tracking code implementation and advertising banner inclusion. Here you can also
choose your favorite color scheme.

3. Managing your video portfolio is as easy as creating/editing a WordPress post: every post is a 
video of your collection.
